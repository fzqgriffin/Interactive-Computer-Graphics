Step1:
1. At line 223, set g_objectRbt[1] for the second cube as its Rbt matrix.
2. At line 234, set g_objectColors[1] for the second cube as its color.
3. At line 337 to line 341, draw the second cube.

Step2:
1. At line 288 to 325 in matrix4.h, implement the functions linFact() and transFact().

Step3:
1. At line 81, set Count_view to decide which view will be used.
2. At line 534 to 579, change the view after pressing ‘v’ and output current view which it is on.

Step4:
1. At line 81 to 83, set Count_object, Count_sky_frame to decide which object to rotate.
2. At line 381 to 463, select a object to rotate and translate.

Step5:
1. At line 481 to 490, implement the function reset().
